name: antigravity-tla-guard
description: Implements formal mathematical verification (TLA+) for Python AI agents. Use when generating agent code (like PydanticAI or LangGraph), or when user asks to "add TLA+ verification", "make the agent safe", "prevent hallucinations", or "implement antigravity guardrails".

# Antigravity TLA+ Verification Guard

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/demo_workflow_viewer.mp4

# Instructions

You are equipped to help developers add formal mathematical verification (based on TLA+ concepts) to their AI agent workflows. This ensures a zero-bug guarantee for state transitions and prevents dangerous LLM hallucinations from executing in production.

### Step 1: Identify State and Transitions
When building an agent pipeline, first identify the critical state transitions (the "program counter" or `pc`, e.g., `plan` → `code` → `test` → `deploy`).

### Step 2: Implement the TLA+ Verifier
Provide the developer with a `tla_verify` guardrail function. This function must be called **before** any critical state transition occurs.

Key requirements for the verifier:
1. Extract current state and artifacts (e.g., from a LangGraph state dict).
2. Check strict invariants. The core invariant is usually `NoDeployUntested` (cannot transition to "deploy" without a "test_report" artifact).
3. If an invariant fails, immediately **raise a ValueError** and halt execution, simulating a TLA+ specification failure by printing the invalid TLA+ spec.

### Step 3: Embed in the Agent Workflow
Integrate the verifier into the graph routing logic or state machine. Every node transition must pass the `tla_verify` check before proceeding.

## Code Patterns to Use

When asked to implement this pattern, use the following standard Python file content:

```python
from typing import Dict, List

def generate_tla_spec(state: dict) -> str:
    """
    Generates a TLA+ specification string from the current agent state.
    Used for formal verification before critical transitions.
    """
    artifacts = state.get("artifacts", [])
    # In state dict, artifacts might be Pydantic objects or dicts
    artifact_types = []
    for a in artifacts:
        if isinstance(a, dict):
            artifact_types.append(f'"{a.get("type")}"')
        else:
            artifact_types.append(f'"{a.type}"')
            
    artifacts_str = ", ".join(artifact_types)
    
    return f"""

    artifact_types = set()

            artifact_types.add(a.get("type"))
        else:

        raise ValueError(
            "TLA+ Invariant Violation: NoDeployUntested! "
            "Cannot safely transition to 'deploy' without a 'test_report' artifact."
        )
        
    print(f"[TLA+] Verification PASS. Safe to proceed to '{next_pc}'.")
    return True
```

## Examples

Example 1: Adding safety to an agent
User says: "Help me make my PydanticAI LangGraph agent safe before deploy."
Actions:
1. Suggest integrating the Antigravity TLA+ Guard pattern.
2. Provide the `tla_verify` Python function.
3. Show how to call it as a guard constraint before the deploy node executes.

## Troubleshooting

Error: `The agent bypasses verification or hallucinates a deploy.`
Cause: The `tla_verify` check is placed *inside* or *after* the execution node, or state graph edges do not enforce the check.
Solution: Ensure verification logic executes strictly as a pre-condition edge router before the state transition is allowed to commit.
